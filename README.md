# Haskell-encounters
This is just dump of my lerning sessions when I tried to grasp misc Haskell idioms and cncepts.

Gibiansky's [IHaskell kernel for IPython](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) was used to record the sessions.
Occasionally I use packages which are not available from bare IHaskell installation. Follow the instructions in section "Where are my packages?" in IHaskell Readme file make required packages available from IHaskell.
